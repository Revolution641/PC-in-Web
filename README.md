# PC-in-Web
A list of OS's (Operating Systems) ported to the web, and accessible.

NOTE: Some of these are NOT full operating systems, but rather ways to test features. A note will be with the ones that are not full OS's.

Windows 11: https://win11.blueedge.me/ (not the full OS, but helpful for testing many features.)

Windows 95: https://lrusso.github.io/Virtual95/Virtual95.htm An in browser full port of the Windows 95 operating system.

Windows XP: https://lrusso.github.io/VirtualXP/VirtualXP.htm by the same person as Virtual95: Windows XP in browser. Slower than 95.
